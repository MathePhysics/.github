Mathephysics is a loosely organized research group led by Akshunna S. Dogra, focusing on the construction of rigorous theories for Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence, and development of principled AI/ML models for mathematical and computational physics settings. 

Our students hail from diverse backgrounds (students have come from Albania, Australia, China, Germany, India, Pakistan, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States) and harbor equally diverse intellectual ambitions (the involved people pursue expertise in various nooks of mathematics, several corners of physics, and the many labyrinthine mazes of machine/deep learning). 

Supervised students have gone on to earn postgraduate positions at institutions such as Oxford University, University College London, University of Michigan, and UT Austin amongst others, and have found employment at reputable financial institutions such as Squarepoint Capital and Funding Circle.

Please email adogra@nyu.edu, if you would like to see what we are all getting up to and/or wish to be involved in some way.
