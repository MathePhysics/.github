Mathephysics is a loosely organized research group founded/led by Akshunna S. Dogra, to better organize the research and codebases he develops with students and peers/collaborators. 

We hail from diverse backgrounds (students have come from Albania, Australia, China, Germany, India, Pakistan, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the United States) and harbor equally diverse intellectual ambitions (the involved people hold/pursue expertise in various nooks of mathematics, several corners of physics, and the many labyrinthine mazes of machine/deep learning). 

Please email adogra@nyu.edu, if you would like to see what we are all getting up to and/or wish to be involved in some way.
